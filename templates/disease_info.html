      <h3>Disease 1: Powdery Mildew</h3>
      <img src="static/mango_powdery_mildew.jpg" alt="Disease 1 Image">
      <p> <strong></strong>  Symptoms: White powdery substance on leaves, stems, and flowers.<br><br>
        Precautions:<br>
        -Ensure proper air circulation by spacing plants appropriately.<br>
        -Avoid overhead watering, as moisture on leaves can promote the growth of powdery mildew.<br>
        -Apply fungicides early in the season as a preventive measure.<br><br>
        Cure:<br>
        -Remove and destroy affected plant parts.<br>

      <h3>Diease 3: Apple Cedar Rust</h3>
      <img src="static/uploads/AppleCedarRust2.JPG" alt="Cherry Powdery Mildew">
      <p>
        <strong>Symptoms:</strong> Early symptoms on apple trees include yellow spots on the upper surfaces of the leaves.
        As the disease progresses, these spots enlarge and bright orange-yellow lesions form on the undersides of the leaves.<br>
        <strong>Precautions:</strong><br> -Plant resistant apple varieties if cedar-apple rust is common in your area. <br>
        -Avoid planting Eastern red cedars near apple trees to prevent cross-infection. <br>
        -Regularly inspect trees for the presence of galls on cedars or leaf lesions on apples, especially in the spring.<br>
        <strong>Cure:</strong> <br> -Apply fungicides labeled for use against cedar-apple rust during the spring, following the product label's instructions for timing and application rates. <br>
        -Prune and dispose of any affected parts of the apple tree to reduce the amount of fungal spores that could spread the disease. <br>

      <h3>Disease 4: Corn Common Rust</h3>
      <img src="static\uploads\CornCommonRust3.JPG" alt="Cercospora Leaf Spot">

        <strong>Symptoms:</strong>Early symptoms include light yellow spots on the upper surfaces of leaves. <br>
        <strong>Precautions:</strong> <br> -Plant rust-resistant corn varieties if common rust is a known issue in the area. <br>
        -Crop rotation can help reduce the fungal spores in the soil. <br>
        -Avoid planting corn after corn, as this can encourage the survival and buildup of rust spores.<br>
        <strong>Cure:</strong> <br> -Fungicides can be effective, particularly if applied when rust first appears and before it becomes severe. <br>
        -If rust appears late in the season or after the silking stage, fungicide application may not be economical.

        <strong>Precautions:</strong> <br> -Use virus-free seeds and transplants. <br>
        -Implement strict vector control, as the virus is most commonly spread by whiteflies. <br>
        -Use insect netting or reflective mulches to prevent whiteflies from reaching the plants.<br>
        <strong>Cure:</strong> <br> -There is no cure once plants are infected with TYLCV. <br>
        -Manage whiteflies with insecticides or biological controls, following the label instructions carefully. <br>
        -Crop rotation and field sanitation can help reduce the likelihood of future infections. <br>
